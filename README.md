# Building Java Projects with Maven
This guide walks you through using Maven to build a simple Java project.

## What you’ll build
You’ll create an application that provides the LocalDateTime and then build it with Maven.

## What you’ll need
+ A favorite text editor or IDE
+ JDK 8 or later
+ Install Maven

## Set up the project
First you’ll need to setup a Java project for Maven to build. To keep the focus on Maven, make the project as simple as possible for now.

### Build Java code
---
Maven is now ready to build the project. You can execute several build lifecycle goals with Maven now, including goals to compile the project’s code, create a library package (such as a JAR file), and install the library in the local Maven dependency repository.

To try out the build, issue the following at the command line:

  `mvn compile`
  + This will run Maven, telling it to execute the compile goal. When it’s finished, you should find the compiled .class files in the target/classes directory.
  + Since it’s unlikely that you’ll want to distribute or work with .class files directly, you’ll probably want to run the package goal instead:

  `mvn package`
  + The package goal will compile your Java code, run any tests, and finish by packaging the code up in a JAR file within the target directory. The name of the JAR file will be based on the project’s `<artifactId>` and `<version>`. For example, given the minimal `pom.xml` file from before, the JAR file will be named demoApp-1.0.0.jar.

    **Note:**  If you’ve changed the value of <packaging> from "jar" to "war", the result will be a WAR file within the target directory instead of a JAR file.

Maven also maintains a repository of dependencies on your local machine (usually in a .m2/repository directory in your home directory) for quick access to project dependencies. If you’d like to install your project’s JAR file to that local repository, then you should invoke the install goal:

`mvn install`

The install goal will compile, test, and package your project’s code and then copy it into the local dependency repository, ready for another project to reference it as a dependency.

Speaking of dependencies, now it’s time to declare dependencies in the Maven build.

### Declare Dependencies
---

The sample DemoApp is completely self-contained and does not depend on any additional libraries. Most applications, however, depend on external libraries to handle common and complex functionality.

For example, suppose that in addition to saying "Hello World!", you want the application to print the current date and time. You could use the date and time facilities in the native Java libraries.

+ `<groupId>` - The group or organization that the dependency belongs to.
+ `<artifactId>` - The library that is required.
+ `<version>` - The specific version of the library that is required.

By default, all dependencies are scoped as `compile` dependencies. That is, they should be available at compile-time (and if you were building a WAR file, including in the /WEB-INF/libs folder of the WAR). Additionally, you may specify a `<scope>` element to specify one of the following scopes:

+ `provided` - Dependencies that are required for compiling the project code, but that will be provided at runtime by a container running the code (e.g., the Java Servlet API).

+ `test` - Dependencies that are used for compiling and running tests, but not required for building or running the project’s runtime code.
```

### Run project
---
+ To run this project run the following command.
    `
      java -jar target/demoApp-1.0.0.jar [OR]
      java -cp target/demoApp-1.0.0.jar demo.DemoApp
    `
